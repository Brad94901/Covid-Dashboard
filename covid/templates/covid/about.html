	<p style="width: 75vw; padding-left: 1vw;">From the inception of the Coronavirus disease pandemic in late 2019, Texas state has reported about 6.37 million cases with about 80,909 deaths as of 5th February 2022 as reported by [1]. A year later, vaccines began rolling out after the approval by CDC (Centers for Disease Control). Vaccines have proven to be the best ways to combat the covid-19 as the vaccines serves as a boost to the immune system. At the preliminary stages of the vaccine roll out, the major concern factor for the slow receptance was generally because people feared the side effects as explained by [2]. With about 74.55% of the Texas state vaccinated with 41.7 million doses administered, 20.1 people vaccinated and 25.11% of the total population fully vaccinated, vaccination is still the best chance for the human body to survive against the various covid-19 strains.</p>  

	<p style="width: 75vw; padding-left: 1vw;">Due to the varied responses by different states, and the differing opinion over the SARS Covid-19 virus there is an inconsistent system for finding timely vaccination appointments or tests due to that information being limited to counties websites rather than a state or even nationwide system. Due to this variance the different counties also have different systems for finding this information, and the aggregation may assist those who do not know where to look.</p>
